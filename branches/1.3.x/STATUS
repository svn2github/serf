Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1804534, r1804543, r1804553
   Fix error handling when reading the outgoing request's body by not
   ignoring such errors in some cases.
   Justification:
     Ignoring errors can cause invalid or undefined behavior further
     down the line.
   Branch:
     ^/serf/branches/1.3.x-fix-outgoing-request-err
   Notes:
     - On trunk, this issue has been fixed in the process of adding
       the pump.c layer.
     - An example of a condition where the error could be incorrectly ignored
       is Subversion's commit, if the error occurs when reading the body of
       an outgoing PUT request.
     - The added test doesn't fail without the fix, but is merely added to
       cover the related code.  (See the r1804541 log message for details.)

 * r1804005, r1804008, r1804016
   Return an error for invalid chunk lengths in the dechunk bucket.
   Justification:
     Invalid chunk lengths should cause an error, as otherwise the data
     could be incorrectly interpreted further down the line.
   Branch:
     ^/serf/branches/1.3.x-r1804008-group
