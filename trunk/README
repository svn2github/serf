Welcome to serf, a high-performance asynchronous HTTP client library.

The serf library is a C-based HTTP client library built upon the Apache
Portable Runtime (APR) library. It multiplexes connections, running the
read/write communication asynchronously. Memory copies and transformations are
kept to a minimum to provide high performance operation.

1. INSTALL

1.1. SCons build system

### double-secret-probation info: the below.. fine. I've been testing
### this with an installed version of scons.


### I've always built with the scons-local package. I'm not sure how
### things look if scons is installed on the system. Here are the
### directions for using scons-local.

Fetch the scons-local package:
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scons/scons-local-2.0.1.tar.gz

Unpack this into the trunk directory (ie. scons.py should be a sibling
of the SConstruct file).

To build serf:

$ ./scons.py

### need to demonstrate switches, prefix, etc
