/*
 * Filtering primitives.
 *
 * All filters are designed as "push" filters. The caller "pushes"
 * data into the filter, it will process the data, then pass the
 * resulting data to the "next" filter.
 *
 * In certain types of applications and callin environments, a "pull"
 * filter is desired. To turn the push filters into "pull" filters, it
 * is assumed that some kind of pull-based data source is available in
 * the environment. In a pull model, the result data would be mapped
 * as:
 *
 *   DATA = F1( F2( F3( SOURCE )))
 *
 * However, the filter chain is organized as:
 *
 *   F3.write(SOURCE) -> F2 -> F1 -> DATA
 *
 * The mapping is performed by inserting a "gathering filter":
 *
 *   ORIG_DATA = get(SOURCE)
 *   F3.write(ORIG_DATA) -> F2 -> F1 -> GATHER
 *   DATA = GATHER.fetch()
 *
 * We have chosen the "push" model as the basis of the filter design,
 * as it can easily be reversed, and the construction of a filter is
 * much more straightforward.
