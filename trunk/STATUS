Release:


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

  * web pages (go to apr-site)

  * decide on layout of the repository (e.g. subdirs)
    Greg thinks: prolly the following: /build, /include, /docs, /test, 
		 /core, and some for high-level items (maybe /filters
		 and /utils)
    Justin says: Fine with me except /core can't be used as autoconf
                 trounces this directory via rm -rf - how about /base?

  * set up config/build structure based on apr-util
    (take this opportunity to simplify again; hopefully to fold these
     simplifications back into apr(-util))

  * release scripts (in /build) (and a how-to-release.txt in docs/)


RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:
